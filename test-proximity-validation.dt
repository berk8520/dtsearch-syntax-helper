// dtSearch Query Test File - Proximity Validation Examples

// These patterns should trigger ambiguous proximity warnings:

// Pattern 1: Complex expressions with proximity operator
(apple AND banana) W/10 (pear AND grape)
(cat OR dog) W/5 (mouse AND bird)

// Pattern 2: Nested proximity expressions  
(apple w/10 banana) w/10 (pear and grape)
(term1 w/5 term2) w/3 (term3 or term4)

// Pattern 3: Multiple proximity operators in sequence
apple w/10 banana w/5 cherry
document w/20 important w/10 information

// These should be fine (clearer proximity usage):
apple W/10 banana
"exact phrase" W/5 keyword
apple AND (banana W/10 cherry)

// Mixed operator validation:
apple AND banana OR cherry

// Noise words (should show hover tooltips):
apple and the banana
document with a keyword

// Test real-time formatting:
apple w5 banana
document w10 keyword
