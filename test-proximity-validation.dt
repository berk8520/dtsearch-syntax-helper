// dtSearch Query Test File - Proximity Validation Examples

// These patterns should trigger ambiguous proximity warnings:

// Pattern 1: Complex expressions with proximity operator
(apple AND banana) W/10 (pear AND grape)
(cat OR dog) W/5 (mouse AND bird)

// Pattern 2: Nested proximity expressions  
(apple w/10 banana) w/10 (pear and grape)
(term1 w/5 term2) w/3 (term3 or term4)

// Pattern 3: Multiple proximity operators in sequence
apple w/10 banana w/5 cherry
document w/20 important w/10 information

apple AND (banana W/10 cherry)

apple AND banana OR cherry
