// dtSearch Query Test File - Proximity Validation Examples

// These patterns should trigger ambiguous proximity warnings:

// Pattern 1: Complex expressions with proximity operator
(apple AND banana) W/10 (pear AND grape)
(cat OR dog) W/5 (mouse AND bird)

// Pattern 2: Nested proximity expressions  
(apple w/10 banana) w/10 (pear and grape)
(term1 w/5 term2) w/3 (term3 or term4)

// Pattern 3: Multiple proximity operators in sequence
apple w/10 banana w/5 cherry
document w/20 important w/10 information

// These should be fine (clearer proximity usage):
apple W/10 banana
"exact phrase" W/5 keyword
apple AND (banana W/10 cherry)

// Mixed operator validation:
apple AND banana OR cherry

// Noise words (should show hover tooltips):
apple and the banana
document with a keyword

// Test real-time formatting:
apple w5 banana
document w10 keyword

// NEW: OR splitting examples (select these and use Ctrl+Shift+S to split):
(dog OR cat OR bird) W/5 (house OR yard OR field)
(red OR blue OR green) AND (car OR truck)
(apple OR orange) W/3 (juice OR smoothie OR drink)
(monday OR tuesday OR wednesday) PRE/2 (meeting OR call)

// QUOTE VALIDATION TESTS:
// This should NOT trigger warning (operators between quoted pairs):
typhoon AND "cebu city" AND resort AND (damage OR landscape OR claim OR audit OR standard OR "nature works" OR tami OR stevenson)

// This SHOULD trigger warning (operators inside quotes):
"apple AND orange" OR "cat AND dog"
"search term with OR operator inside"

// This should NOT trigger warning (operators outside quotes):
"apple" AND "orange" OR "banana"

// AUTO-FIX TEST CASES (select these and use Ctrl+Shift+X to auto-fix):

// Duplicate operators:
apple AND AND banana
cat OR OR dog OR OR bird
document AND AND AND contract

// Unbalanced parentheses:
(apple AND banana
cat OR (dog AND bird
((nested parens)
extra closing)))

// Unbalanced quotes:
"apple AND banana
"quoted phrase without closing

// Common misspellings:
appel AND banan W/5 documnt
contrat OR agrement AND adress
goverment AND managment W/3 comittee

// Nautical/Maritime misspellings:
"yact charter" W/5 (boat OR captin OR shoar)
harber AND marinah OR ancher
navagation AND passanger W/10 equipement

// Invalid proximity operators:
apple w5 banana
document pre10 contract
search w20 term

// Mixed case operators:
apple and banana or cherry
document AND contract or agreement

// Improper nested proximity operators:
(apple W/10 banana W/5 cherry)
(term1 PRE/5 term2 W/3 term3)
(contract NEAR agreement W/10 document)
(apple w/10 banana w/5 cherry w/3 grape)

// Mixed boolean and proximity operators (ambiguous precedence):
(dog OR cat OR bird) AND (adoption OR rescue W/10 shelter)
(apple OR banana W/5 tree)
(contract AND agreement W/10 document OR clause)
(red OR blue W/3 car AND fast)

// Excessive spaces:
apple    AND    banana     OR     cherry
"phrase   with    spaces"     AND    term

// PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION TEST CASES (select these and use Ctrl+Shift+X to review warnings):

// Leading wildcards (very slow):
*apple AND banana
contract OR *agreement
(*cat OR *dog) AND house

// Too many OR terms in one group (>10):
(apple OR banana OR cherry OR grape OR orange OR lemon OR lime OR peach OR plum OR berry OR mango OR kiwi) AND fruit

// Nested wildcards (inefficient):
app*le*
con*tra*ct
man*age*ment AND docu*me*nt

// Very wide proximity ranges (slow):
apple W/150 banana
contract W/500 agreement
document W/1000 important

// Multiple leading wildcards in OR group (extremely slow):
(*apple OR *banana OR *cherry) AND fruit
(*contract OR *agreement OR *document) W/10 legal

// RAINBOW BRACKETS TEST CASES (observe the colorful nested parentheses):

// Simple nesting:
(apple AND banana)
((apple AND banana) OR (cherry AND grape))

// Complex nesting levels:
(((apple OR banana) AND (cherry OR grape)) W/10 ((document OR contract) AND (agreement OR clause)))

// Deep nesting with mixed operators:
((((red OR blue) AND (fast OR slow)) W/5 ((car OR truck) AND (new OR old))) OR (((green OR yellow) AND (big OR small)) W/3 ((bike OR cycle) AND (road OR mountain))))

// Real-world complex query with rainbow brackets:
(((contract OR agreement) AND (legal OR binding)) W/10 (((party OR entity) AND (first OR second)) OR ((clause OR section) AND (term OR condition))))

// Unbalanced for testing error highlighting:
(((apple AND banana) OR (cherry AND grape)
((document OR contract) AND (agreement OR clause))))

// QUERY TREE VIEW TEST CASES (observe in the sidebar dtSearch Query Tree):

// TEST CASE FOR OR IN ORANGE BUG FIX:
(apple OR orange) W/3 (juice OR smoothie OR drink)

// TEST CASE FOR MULTI-LINE POSITION TRACKING:
// Right-click on each of these lines individually to test position tracking
apple AND banana OR cherry
(contract OR agreement) W/10 document
"exact phrase" AND wildcard*

// TREE VIEW INDENTATION TEST CASES (observe improved hierarchy in sidebar):

// Simple operator with terms:
apple AND banana

// Complex nested structure:
(contract OR agreement) AND (legal OR binding) W/10 document

// Multiple operators with clear hierarchy:
apple AND banana OR cherry AND document W/5 legal

// Deep nesting to show indentation levels:
((term1 OR term2) AND (term3 OR term4)) W/10 ((result1 OR result2) AND final)

// Mixed content types for visual separation:
"exact phrase" AND wildcard* OR (group AND terms) W/3 proximity

// Real-world complex query:
((contract OR agreement OR document) AND (legal OR binding OR valid)) W/20 (((party OR entity OR organization) AND (first OR second OR third)) OR ((clause OR section OR provision) AND (term OR condition OR requirement)))

// OPERATOR FLOW DIAGRAM TEST CASES (right-click and select "Show Operator Flow Diagram"):

// Simple precedence example:
apple AND banana OR cherry

// Complex precedence with proximity:
(contract OR agreement) AND document W/10 legal NOT invalid

// Multiple proximity operators:
apple W/5 banana PRE/3 cherry AND document

// Nested groups with mixed operators:
((term1 OR term2) AND (term3 OR term4)) W/10 (result NOT excluded)

// Performance analysis example:
*leading AND trailing* OR (many OR terms OR in OR single OR group OR for OR performance OR analysis OR here OR over OR ten OR terms)

// Real-world legal query flow:
((contract OR agreement) AND (binding OR valid)) W/15 ((party OR entity) AND (first OR second)) NOT (void OR invalid OR terminated)
